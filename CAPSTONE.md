# Project Name

VHDLChecker

# Project Description

Let's Get Rusty Accelerator Bootcamp Capstone about **VHDL** helper tools

# Project Objectives:

Dealing with [VHDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHDL), especially in projects related to [ASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit) at work, imply to comply wtih technical and bureaucratic tasks. A good deal of those tasks might be sped up with tailored helper tools. 

## 1. Understand fundamentals.

 * VHDL grammar: e.g. classic [ANTLR Grammar](https://github.com/VHDL/ANTLR4-Grammars/tree/master/vhdl)

 * Preprocess VHDL files to collect useful metadata: e.g. compilation order

 * Process VHDL files to comply with project rules: e.g. all constants in capitol letters

 * Wrapper that code inside libraries that can be invoked by other languages: e.g. C++ or Python

 * Simple CLI to deal with those libraries by humans

 * Wrappers to deal with those libraries by AI

 
## 2. Implement it in Rust.

* Preprocessing and processing already generate VHDL grammar

* Invoking external already existing VHDL tools

* Applying standard CLI approaches

* Wrappers for AIs

## 3. Solidify your Rust skills.

* Be able to invoke external tools, e.g. *Java* ANTLR VHDL grammar generator during building time

* Be able to invoke external tools, e.g. open source VHDL [ghdl](https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl) compilers at run time

* Be able to deal with completely new Rust libraries out of my comfort zone, e.g. **AI wrappers**

* Be able to debug on my own not that common errors, e.g. grammar wrong callbacks or experimental AI wrappers.

* Be able to design, implement and maintain real but humble professional helper tools in Rust

* Be able to share the project to collaborators by meaningfully splitting it or providing testing *Dockerfile*

# Project Milestones:

## Week 1

### 1. Understand fundamentals

 * Learn about ANTLR VHDL grammar

 * Try to **SELL YOUR IDEA TO YOUR BOSS AT WORK**

 * Discover how many **stoppers** you should remove at work in the future to be able to use Rust based tools

### 3. Brainstorm

Initial plan after discussing during our Rust meeting and, especially, with senior colleagues at work

### 4. Experiment

Planned POC just to prepocess a bunch of VHDL and look for compilation dependencies

### 5. Notify your instructor
Inform your instructor on Discord that you have chosen this project.

## Week 2

VHDL main actions

## Week 3

AI main actions 

### Showcase progress:

Notify your instructor if youâ€™d like to showcase your work on Discord or during a live call.
Share your progress on Discord and/or during a live call.

## Optional Enhancements:

### 1. Offline generation

### 2. Offline AI Integration
